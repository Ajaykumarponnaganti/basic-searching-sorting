# Searching and Sorting

Searching is the process of finding an element in a collection of data (like an array, list, or database). You want to locate a specific item or value and possibly return its position or presence in the collection.

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order. This is often done to make searching faster and to help with various types of analysis.

## Common Searching Algorithms

- **Linear Search** - Checks every element in the collection one by one. It's simple but not efficient for large data sets.
- **Binary Search** - Requires a sorted collection and checks the middle element to repeatedly narrow down the search space, making it much faster than linear search.

## Common Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort** - Steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.
- **Quick Sort** - Divides the collection into smaller sublists and sorts them independently.
- **Merge Sort** - Divides the collection into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.
- **insertion Sort** - Builds the sorted list one item at a time.
